**AdminLTE** is a fully responsive administration template. Based on **[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)** framework and also the JavaScript plugins.
Highly customizable and easy to use. Fits many screen resolutions from small mobile devices to large desktops.

# Important

This is just a temporary repo for `AdminLTEv4` to be used as stable version, I will delete this repo once AdminLTE v4 released their final version.

# But Why ?
I want to release a Laravel package using AdminLTEv4 but I can't install it because the status of original repo as beta-3 so I created this repo to installed as stable version, and I'll keep updating it with latest beta version until final release comes.
